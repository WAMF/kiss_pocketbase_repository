# PocketBase Repository

A PocketBase implementation of the `kiss_repository` interface.

## Overview

This package provides a clean and simple repository interface for PocketBase, following the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. It implements the same `Repository<T>` interface as `kiss_firebase_repository`, allowing you to easily switch between PocketBase and Firebase backends.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Simple repository interface for CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Type-safe data conversions between Dart and PocketBase
- ‚úÖ Support for batch operations
- ‚úÖ Real-time streaming with PocketBase subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Flexible query building
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated PocketBase IDs
- ‚úÖ Built-in error handling
- ‚úÖ Pure Dart package (works in any Dart environment)

## üéØ PocketBase Essentials for Developers

### Collections & Schemas
- PocketBase uses predefined field schemas
- Create collections in Admin Dashboard first
- Types: `base` (data), `auth` (users), `view` (read-only)

### Authentication Architecture

**üîê Authentication Collections**

PocketBase handles user authentication through specialized collections:

1. **Auth Collections as User Storage**
   - Mark collection as `auth` type in Admin Dashboard  
   - Includes built-in fields: `email`, `password`, `verified`, `tokenKey`
   - Add custom fields: `name`, `avatar`, `department`
   - **Replaces traditional role systems** - collections can act as broad role types (`admins`, `staff`, `customers`) or use role fields within collections

2. **User Record Creation**
   - Admin Dashboard interface
   - API calls with administrative privileges
   - Self-registration (controlled by `createRule`)

### Permission Model
```javascript
// Reference collection type (broad roles)
createRule: "@request.auth.collectionName = 'staff'"

// Reference role fields (granular roles)  
deleteRule: "@request.auth.role = 'admin'"

// Combined approach
updateRule: "@request.auth.collectionName = 'staff' && @request.auth.role = 'manager'"
```

### Practical Workflow
1. Create collections in Admin Dashboard
2. Define API rules for permissions  
3. Use repository library for CRUD operations

**üí° Key Concept:** Auth collections replace traditional user/role tables with flexible, rule-driven permissions.
